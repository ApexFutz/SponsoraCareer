Dreamer:

( Profile:

    ((Name:			))

((Bio: ))
((Goal: ))

(Timeline:
((Expected Duration (Ai will help formulate and structure growth, IT WILL BE A RANGE))

(Financial Obligation:
((Example: Dreamer needs $800 after tax weekly to pay bills, Expected Duration is 6-9 months
that would mean The Dreamer would need $21,200 - $31,200 evenly split upon that range))

Funds are held in escrow and automatically deducted and sent to dreamer over this time period

There will be a contractual obligation to both parties to fulfill this notion to the ends defined by the contract.

Down Payment (if any): Placed parallel to the acceptance of the contract, when down payment is submitted the transaction occurs in its entirety

Back payments (if any): Begins at a pre determined time after the Expected Range (the most current version)

Format: Dreamer posts profile, Sponsors will send offers that Dreamer accepts/denies, Sponsors can also simply donate to the cause, reducing the overall required value to proceed.

Note: Sponsors can also attempt to supply other connective means to enable their journey (they wont always need just capital, maybe they need connections, mentorships, internships, experience etc.)

**What if instead of a loan its equity?**

If their dream is to make a business/help their business etc. then they could always offer % of their business at a fair rate. maybe a mixed deal with cash + equity.

**What if the Dream takes less time?**

Affirmation of the Dream being accomplished would be shown, the payments will stop at the discretion of both parties and the Dreamer pays whatever that prorated amount is divided by the same payment range.

Certain % Portions can be donation/loans if desired by the sponsor

Why Invest?

Instead of investing in a startup or a known blue chip company, you are investing in someone trying to better themselves. that has proven they are capable of holding a job in many cases and have enough work ethic to attempt this on top of it, in short, they aren't afraid of the work, the just need a little help.

What if their goal is something you need at your company?

Even better! you get the opportunity to mold the candidate from their first steps in this new space. there is no better first impression than helping someone in need.

Its a Win/Win!

What if??

What if the Dreamer quits?

The Dreamer is still responsible for fulfilling the financial obligations of the contract. if they opt out then they can end incoming payments and pay the prorated amount.
